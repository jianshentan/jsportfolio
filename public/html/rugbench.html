    <b>Rug Bench</b>, 2013 Winter, allows users to transport dogs in a sturdy, iconic, piece of luggage. Dogs are a particularly difficult object to travel with, however Dog Case is formally tailored to canines, for easy portability. The wheels make it easy to take your dog from home to the airport and beyond. Specificity and a consideration of user needs are two of the central tenets in design philosophy, and it is the designer's job to thoroughly examine the particular behaviors and people which will employ a piece of equipment.

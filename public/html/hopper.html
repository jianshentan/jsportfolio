    <br><br>
    It&#39s hard to find a good party: there is either not enough information about parties nearby or too many available parties to choose from. Even if you do find a place to start your night, hopping from party to party is something that happens frequently. Sometimes, people end up at events that do not meet their expectations but have trouble finding out where to go to next. Other times, people want to meet with friends at multiple venues without the inconvenience of texting or calling. 
    <br><br>
    There are services that help users find parties ahead of time, but none of them provide user-rated real time information about the best parties nearby. In addition, general purpose social media sites do not provide social experience tailored for the sharing of night life. Given the importance of parties to many people&#39s social life, this is a still relatively untouched domain.
    <br><br><br>
    <b style="color:ee3b3a;">Our Solution: Hopper</b>
    <br><br>
    Hopper is a mobile application that provides user-rated real time information about the best parties. Hopper displays available parties that your friends are attending or hosting. Our solution is user-centric: there is no divide between users who are looking for parties and those who host them. Instead, users can upvote parties which would automatically share them with his/her friends giving users the ability to both consume and spread information simultaneously. This naturally builds a network of ranked parties in real time, creating a snapshot of the party landscape at that moment. 
    <br><br>
    Hopper's lightweight design allows users to enter and exit the application with just a few clicks encouraging them to check in regularly. Hopper also keeps a log of your night and helps users stay connected with friends by eliminating the inconvenience of text messages and calls in loud settings. 
    <br><br><br>
    <b style="color:ee3b3a;">Development</b>
    <br><br>
    Hopper is currently being developed for Android and iOS. The server uses Node.js with MongoDB. Our first iteration of Hopper is planned for release in the spring of 2014.

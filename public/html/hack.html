            <b>People's Magazine Generator</b>, 2014 Spring, is a tumblr bot that generators People's Magazine Covers. It works with PopGossipUSA to get generator gossip based on current celebrity-news and then searches google-images for a relevant image to pair the text with.

            This Tumblr bot was made using Node.js

            <b>POPGossipUSA</b>, 2013 Fall, produces fake gossip every 4 hours about the latest celebrities that have made headlines. At the same time, it tags and follows every celebrity it tweets about, hoping to increase its own social presence. Instead of presenting itself as a Twitter bot, I wanted it to appear as a serious media-sharing account-- it&#39s Tweets are almost mundane enough to take seriously and believe. 
            <br><br>
            Unlike @acronym_dictionary that is about each tweet as an individual consumable product, I want PopGossipUSA to be about the twitter account and the idea of a bot as a personality instead of an algorithm that generates interesting language. I want to automate the relationship that many big celebrity media outlets have with the public.

            <b>Acronym Dictionary</b>, 2013 Fall, uses text from twelve different novels. The bot starts by parsing through these novels and storing data about every word&#39s subsequent word and the probability that it should occur after the given word. With Acronym_diction, the intention was to produce interesting and digestible language - tweets that appeared as little treats on someone&#39s feed.

            <b>The Tower Game</b>, 2012 Spring
            <br><br>
            In this game, the player encounters dead bodies that look identical to himself. As he makes his way up the tower with the intention of rescuing the princess, he discovers more about these dead bodies, who they are and how they've died. While the player learns about previous attempts to climb the tower, the gamer, separate from the player, contemplates their experience playing the game. How did I die previously? As a player, why can I see my previous lives? 
            <br><br>
            Concurrently, the game draws from conventional gaming elements (such as battles, collecting items, character growth) to create the expectation of death. Ironically, the player, surrounded by the expectation of death (and ghosts), is unable to die (at least not until the end). This separates gameplay (the gamer's "death") from content (the player's encounters with death) and changes it from being a consequence of gameplay to the subject of the game.

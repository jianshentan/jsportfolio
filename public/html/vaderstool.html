    <b>Vader Stool</b>, 2013 Winter
    <br><br>
    Ever wanted to sit on the face of Evil? [warning: Evil may not be comfortable]
    <br><br>
    This piece was informed primarily by process. We wanted the quick, almost haphazard, construction to embody the playful spirit of the piece. By putting two disparate materials together, we are able to combine the amorphous qualities of the concrete with the clean lines of the wood.

        This stool addresses more traditional uses of concrete and wood in furniture making practices. While this combination is typically used to exploit the unique properties of both materials - to make serious, functional and enduring furniture - we wanted this object to poke fun at this tradition in order to give design a more playful purpose. So how better to do this than to sit on the uncomfortable face of Darth Vader - the face of evil? How better to express this than to throw wooden dowels into drying concrete to create seemingly haphazard joinery? Ultimately the humor is in the action that created these pieces as much as in the imagery we play with.

    <b>DIY Bench</b>, 2013 Spring, is about democratizing and open-sourcing design. For this project, I created a "template" for a bench [the design above]. I constructed six of these templates and gave the bench away to students in other disciplines. The template that they were given was a DIY kit that they could construct themselves with nothing but a screw driver. Other than that, they could do whatever they wanted to the bench to redesign it. Students in disciplines that focused on structural design utilised machines to alter the form of the bench, while students who were more interested in surface focused on redesigning a surface for the bench- either way, the bench became an object that they designed, created and (for the most part) now live with.

    <b>Story:</b>
    <br><br>
    "... men of various nations had an identical dream. They saw a woman running at night through an unknown city; she was seem from behind, with long hair, and she was naked. They dreamed of pursuing her. As they twisted and turned, each of them lost her. After the dream, they set out in search of that city; they never found it, but they found one another; they decided to build a city like the one in the dream. In laying out the streets, each followed the course of his pursuit; at the spot where they lost the fugitive's trail, they arranged spaces and walls differently from the dream so she would be unable to escape again. This was the city of Zobeide, where they settled, waiting for that scene to be repeated on night. None of them, asleep or awake, ever saw the woman again."

    Our story takes place thousands of years later. Zobeide is a city of the future. It is congested, unorganized and ugly. Our protagnoists - a citizen of the city of Zobeide - dreams of his city. In his dreams, he encounters a strange humanoid creature. He chases the creature but always loses it in pursuit. After the dream, he sets out to block off the parts of the city that the humanoid creature escapes from expecting that he will catch the creature in his next dream. However, each time he blocks off a part of the city, the city crumbles and deteriotes away. Unaware of this, he helplessly continues his mission, hoping that one day he will finally catch this creature.

    <b>Gameplay:</b>
    <br><br>
    The City of Zobeide is a puzzle-adventure role-playing game (RPG) that challenges both traditional gaming mechanisms and the genre of adventure RPGs. In this game, the puzzle at hand doesn't always take place inside the gaming environment. The player must often think outside the box to move forward - the literal box in which the game is contained in. We want to include the language of personal computing (desktop, windows, file-systems) into the story-telling of our game.

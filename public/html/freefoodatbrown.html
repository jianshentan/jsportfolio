    <b>The Website: </b>
    <br>
    Free Food At Brown is an experiment in speedy creation. We wanted to see how quickly we could build and launch a project in a strict time limit. 4 persons, 36 hours, and many mouse clicks later, we are proud to present to you: Free Food at Brown.
    <br><br>

    <b>Who: </b>
    <br>
    This project was also made as a collaborative effort between Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design. It was made with Charles Yeh (Brown &#39 14), Sam Jau (RISD &#39 14) and Max Song (Brown &#39 14).
    <br><br>

    <b>Why: </b>
    <br>
    Student groups go to great lengths to procure free food. We want to amplify their generosity to a broader audience, and also create opportunities for fortuitous encounters. So, go eat free food, and learn something new!
    <br><br>

    <b>How It Works: </b>
    <br>
    Free food events are found by adaptive magic, so keep checking back, the site will get smarter with time.
